        <p>
            My name is Andreana Parafinczuk, and I am currently a student interested in learning more about web development and design.
            I enjoy being creative and working with technology, especially when I can build things that are both functional and visually appealing.
            I am continuing to grow my skills in HTML and CSS and hope to become more confident in creating complete websites.
            In the future, I hope to use these skills in a career that allows me to combine creativity with problem-solving.
